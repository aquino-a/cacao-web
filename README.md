# CacaoWeb

This is the front end for a chat app I called cacao, which comes from the korean chat app called kakao.
You can add friends and message them.
You authenticate using google.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Deploy

The backend is setup in maven to build the app, and then is statically served.
You can deploy on a separate server, but need to change the environment variables to match the backend location.
